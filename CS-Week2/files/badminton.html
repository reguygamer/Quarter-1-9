<h1>Badminton</h1>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>A 50-year-old weighing 70kg can burn 385 calories during an hour of social badminton. And aside from calorie burning, keeping active gives you more energy, relieves stress and boosts your mood.</li>
    <li>Badminton is the fastest racket sport, with shuttles clocking up speeds in excess of 200mph. The fastest badminton hit in competition was 332kph (206mph) by Fu Haifeng of China during the 2005 Sudirman Cup.</li>
    <li>With shuttlecocks drifting easily across the court, it’s easy to keep a gentle rally going. Badminton England’s ‘No Strings Badminton’ places you in games with people of your own standard, so the game remains fun and relaxed.</li>
